Please go through all the installation steps below and make sure that
you not only installed them, but start them up to make sure they're working.
If you have any problems, don't hesitate to email the instructors to
ask for help, or arrive early on the first day of the workshop to
get help.

<ol>
<li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
<br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have
Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set!
<br>
If you need a spreadsheet
program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install
instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.
       <ul>
          <li><b>Download the Installer</b>
        <br>Install LibreOffice by going to the <a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/>installation page</a>. The version for Mac
should automatically be selected. Click on the button below "Main Installer" <b>Download Version x.y.z</b>. You
will go to a page that asks about a donation, but you don't need to make one.
Your download should begin automatically.
          <li><b>Install LibreOffice</b>
            <br>Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and it should install.
<li>To use LibreOffice, double click on the icon and it will open.
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>OpenRefine</b>
<br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning
that runs through a web browser, and any browser -
Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer - should work fine.
You will need to download Google Refine and install it,
and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need
an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
<ul>
<li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download
page</a>
<li>Click on <i>Mac kit</i> to download the install file
<li>Open the downloaded .dmg file
<li>Drag the icon in to the Applications folder
<li>Double click on the icon and Google Refine will then open in your web browser.
<li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should see OpenRefine.
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>Python</b>
<br>
<a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
a bit difficult, so we recommend
<a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
an all-in-one installer.
<br>
  Regardless of how you choose to install it,
  <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
  (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
<br>
We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
Firefox browsers are all
<a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
(some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
and below, are not).
<br>
To install (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcSAln46u9U">Video Tutorial</a>):
<ul>
  <li>Open <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">http://continuum.io/downloads</a> with your web browser.</li>
  <li>Download the Python 3 installer for OS X.</li>
  <li>Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.</li>
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>SQLite</b>
<br>
For this workshop we're going to use the Firefox SQLite Plugin. It works through
the web browser Firefox.
<ul>
<li>If you don't already have Firefox installed <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>install Firefox</a>
<li>Start Firefox
<li>Go to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">plugin homepage</a>.
<li> Click the "Add Now" button.
<li> Click "Install Now" on the dialog that appears after the download completes.
<li> Restart Firefox when prompted.
<li> Select "SQLite Manager" from the "Tools" menu and it will open within Firefox
</ul>
</ol>
